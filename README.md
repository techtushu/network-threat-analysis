# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Network Attack Detection Using PCAP Files

This project investigates real-world network attack traffic by analyzing `.pcap` files using tools like **Wireshark**, **Zeek**, and **CyberChef**. It demonstrates how to detect and document various types of attacks, extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), decode payloads, and map them to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- Perform traffic analysis on various attack PCAPs
- Detect network-based attack patterns and techniques
- Extract IOCs like IPs, domains, and payloads
- Decode embedded data (e.g., base64 in DNS queries)
- Practice using Wireshark filters and Zeek logs
- Map attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK framework

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
- [Zeek](https://zeek.org/)
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
- Command-line tools (`base64`, `strings`)
- [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)

## üìä Analyzed Attacks

| Attack Type        | Description                             | MITRE Technique | Status |

## ‚úÖ Completed Analysis: DNS Tunneling

- PCAP: [`dns_tunneling.pcapng`](./pcaps/dns_tunneling.pcapng)
- Report: [`dns_tunneling.md`](./analysis/dns_tunneling.md)
- IOCs: [`dns_tunneling_iocs.txt`](./threats/dns_tunneling_iocs.txt)
- Screenshot: ![View](./images/dns_tunneling_packet_view.png)

> Malicious DNS TXT queries were used to encode and exfiltrate data such as `admin:password`, decoded from base64 strings embedded in subdomains.

## üß† What I Learned

> This project gave me practical experience in packet analysis, threat detection, and network security. I improved my skills in Wireshark, decoding encoded payloads, identifying malicious patterns, and understanding attacker behavior through real-world packet captures.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Add more attack types (Nmap, ARP Spoofing, etc.)
- Automate IOC extraction using scripts
- Try replaying PCAPs in a lab for live analysis
